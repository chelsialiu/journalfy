# journalfy

With this application, journal-keeping is made simple. Users can keep track of their memories either through writing entries, taking photos, or recording videos. 

1. WRITE
This option is similar to a typical Notes widget, allowing someone to write an entry. 
Although these entries are being saved to the phone, additional work is being done to properly display those text files to the user.

2. CAPTURE
This camera feature allows users to switch from the front to the back camera and also take portrait and landscape pictures. After capturing a picture, it is saved and can be viewed in the Gallery. 

3. RECORD
This video camera feature allows users to switch from the front to the back camera and also record portrait and landscape videos. After recording a video, it is saved and can be played in the Gallery. The video camera also displays a timer, letting the user know how long their video recording is.

This may be a simple app, but most journal apps out there do not give users ALL three of these options to record journal entries. Additionally, more features will be added to the application to enhance user experience and app functionality.
